## Description
To build an image from a Dockerfile, run the following command where the Dockerfile is located:
```
sudo docker build -t NAME .
```

To run the image already build from Docker Hub, run the following command:
```
sudo docker run -t -i NAME
```

For now, these are the images on my Docker Hub:
sbonami/snap

The URL of my Docker Hub: https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sbonami
